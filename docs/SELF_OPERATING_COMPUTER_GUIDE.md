# 🎮 Self-Operating Computer - Complete Guide

**Autonomous AI Computer Control powered by Gemini Vision**

Inspired by [OthersideAI's self-operating-computer](https://github.com/OthersideAI/self-operating-computer), this feature enables AI to autonomously control your computer by viewing the screen and performing mouse/keyboard actions to accomplish objectives.

---

## 🌟 What It Does

The Self-Operating Computer is an AI agent that:
- **Views your screen** like a human would (takes screenshots)
- **Analyzes what it sees** using Gemini Vision AI
- **Decides the next action** based on the objective and current screen state
- **Executes mouse/keyboard actions** automatically
- **Repeats until the objective is complete** or max iterations reached

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: GUI Interface (Recommended)

1. **Open VATSAL GUI App**
   ```bash
   python gui_app.py
   ```

2. **Navigate to the "🎮 Self-Operating" tab**

3. **Enter your objective** in the text box, for example:
   - "Open Google Chrome and search for Python tutorials"
   - "Open Calculator and calculate 25 × 47"
   - "Create a new folder on Desktop named 'AI Projects'"

4. **Choose your mode:**
   
   **Manual Mode (Default):**
   - **▶️ Start (Text)**: Uses the objective you typed
   - **🎤 Start (Voice)**: Listen for spoken objective
   
   **Auto Self-Control Mode (Toggle):**
   - Click the **🔄 Auto Self-Control Mode** toggle button to enable
   - When **✅ Enabled**: Press **Ctrl+Enter** in the objective field to quick-start
   - AI automatically enters self-operating mode when you give a command
   - When **❌ Disabled**: Manual control, use Start buttons

5. **Watch the AI work!**
   - Real-time output shows what the AI is thinking and doing
   - Status indicator shows current state
   - Screenshots are saved to `screenshots/` folder

6. **Stop if needed**
   - Click **⏹️ Stop** button to interrupt
   - Or move mouse to screen corner (PyAutoGUI failsafe)

### Option 2: CLI Interface

```bash
python self_operating_computer.py
```

Then choose:
1. **Text input** - Type your objective
2. **Voice input** - Speak your objective
3. **Exit**

---

## 🔄 Auto Self-Control Mode (New!)

The **Auto Self-Control Mode** toggle button lets you enable/disable automatic self-operating mode activation.

### How It Works

**When Enabled (✅):**
- Press **Ctrl+Enter** in the objective field to instantly start self-operating
- AI automatically begins autonomous control without clicking Start button
- Perfect for rapid testing and quick automations
- Toggle button shows green "✅ Enabled"

**When Disabled (❌):**
- Default manual mode
- You must click **▶️ Start (Text)** or **🎤 Start (Voice)** buttons
- More deliberate control over when AI takes over
- Toggle button shows red "❌ Disabled"

### Quick Start Workflow

1. Type your objective in the text box
2. Enable Auto Self-Control Mode (toggle button)
3. Press **Ctrl+Enter** 
4. AI immediately starts working! 🚀

### Benefits

✅ **Faster workflow** - No need to click Start button  
✅ **Keyboard-driven** - Keep hands on keyboard  
✅ **Toggle anytime** - Switch modes on the fly  
✅ **Visual feedback** - Clear status indicators

## 🎯 How It Works

### The AI Decision Loop

```
1. 📸 Take Screenshot
   └─> AI sees your current screen
   
2. 🧠 Analyze with Gemini Vision
   └─> AI understands what's on screen
       - Buttons, text, windows, applications
       - Current state vs. desired objective
   
3. 💭 Decide Next Action
   └─> AI thinks: "What should I do next?"
       - Move mouse to X, Y
       - Click button
       - Type text
       - Press keyboard key
       - Scroll page
   
4. ⚡ Execute Action
   └─> PyAutoGUI performs the action
   
5. 🔄 Repeat
   └─> Loop until objective complete
       - Max 30 iterations per session
       - AI marks "completed" when done
```

### Available Actions

The AI can perform these actions:

| Action | Description | Parameters |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `move_mouse` | Move cursor to position | x, y coordinates |
| `click` | Click mouse button | button (left/right/middle), x, y, clicks |
| `type_text` | Type text at cursor | text string |
| `press_key` | Press keyboard key | key name (enter, tab, etc.) |
| `hotkey` | Press key combination | keys (["ctrl", "c"]) |
| `scroll` | Scroll screen | direction (up/down), amount |
| `wait` | Pause execution | seconds |
| `complete` | Mark as complete | summary message |

---

## 🎤 Voice Input Mode

The voice mode uses speech recognition to capture your objective:

1. Click **🎤 Start (Voice)** button
2. Wait for "Listening..." message
3. Clearly state your objective (10-15 seconds max)
4. AI processes your speech and starts working

**Requirements:**
- Microphone access
- `SpeechRecognition` package (already installed)
- Clear, quiet environment

**Tips:**
- Speak clearly and slowly
- State complete objective in one sentence
- Avoid background noise

self.max_iterations = 30

# PyAutoGUI pause between actions (default: 0.5s)
pyautogui.PAUSE = 0.5

# Gemini model (default: gemini-2.0-flash-exp)
model = 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp'

# Temperature (default: 0.3)
temperature = 0.3
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Gemini API key not found"
**Solution:** Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env` file

### "Voice input failed"
**Causes:**
- No microphone detected
- Poor audio quality
- Too quiet or too noisy

**Solution:** Check microphone settings, speak clearly

### "Max iterations reached"
**Cause:** Objective too complex or AI got stuck

**Solution:**
- Simplify the objective
- Break into smaller steps
- Check screenshots to see what went wrong

### AI keeps clicking wrong element
**Cause:** Screen resolution or UI element positioning

**Solution:**
- Ensure screen elements are visible and clear
- Try simpler UI navigation
- Check screen resolution matches

### Actions too fast/slow
**Solution:** Adjust `pyautogui.PAUSE` in code:
```python
pyautogui.PAUSE = 1.0  # Slower
pyautogui.PAUSE = 0.2  # Faster
```

---

## 🎓 Advanced Usage

### Session Logs

Save detailed session logs:

```python
# In CLI mode, you'll be asked:
# "Save session log? (y/n)"

# Logs saved as:
# session_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
```

Log contains:
- Objective
- All iterations
- AI thoughts and actions
- Completion status
- Duration

### Programmatic Use

```python
from self_operating_computer import SelfOperatingComputer

# Initialize
computer = SelfOperatingComputer(verbose=True)

# Run with text objective
result = computer.operate("Open Calculator and calculate 5 + 7")

# Run with voice objective
result = computer.operate_with_voice()

# Check result
if result.get("completed"):
    print(f"✅ Success! Took {result['duration_seconds']}s")
    print(f"Iterations: {result['iterations']}")
else:
    print("⚠️ Incomplete")
```
