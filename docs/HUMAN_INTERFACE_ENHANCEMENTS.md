## 🎭 How the Human-Like Interface Works

### Two-Step Interaction Flow

#### Option 1: Separate Wake Word + Command
```
User: "Bhai"
System: [Random response] "Yes, how can I help?" or "Ji, I am listening"
User: "Open WhatsApp"
System: [Executes command]
```

#### Option 2: Combined Wake Word + Command
```
User: "Vatsal open Chrome"
System: [Random response] "On it" or "Right away"
System: [Executes command immediately]
```

### Natural Conversation Example
```
🎤 User: "Bhai"
✅ Wake word detected! Listening for command...
🗣️ System: "At your service"

🎤 User: "open WhatsApp"
✅ Executing command: open whatsapp
▶️ Command sent to callback successfully
```
