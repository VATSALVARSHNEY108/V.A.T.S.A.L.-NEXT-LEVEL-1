## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Sleep Scheduling
- ✅ Works great for one-time scheduling ("sleep at 11pm")
- ⚠️ Cannot be cancelled once set
- 💡 For recurring/critical schedules, use Windows Task Scheduler

### Timers & Alarms
- ✅ Perfect for short-term reminders while using computer
- ⚠️ Basic notification system (not wake-from-sleep alarm)
- 💡 For critical alarms, use your phone or dedicated alarm app

### Windows-Specific Features
Some features work best/only on Windows:
- List open windows (Windows only)
- Clipboard (requires xclip on Linux)
- Window management (optimized for Windows)
