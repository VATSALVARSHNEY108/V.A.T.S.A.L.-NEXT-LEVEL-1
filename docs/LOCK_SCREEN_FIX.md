# Lock Screen & System Control - FIXED ✅

## Problem Fixed
The "lock the screen" command was giving error: **"Unknown action: lock_screen"** in the GUI app.

## Root Cause
The VATSAL automator's Gemini AI prompt didn't include `lock_screen` in its list of known actions, so Gemini couldn't generate the correct command.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Added System Control Actions to VATSAL Automator** (`vatsal_desktop_automator.py`)
   - ✅ Added `lock_screen` action handler
   - ✅ Added `shutdown_system` action handler  
   - ✅ Added `restart_system` action handler
   - ✅ Added `cancel_shutdown` action handler

### 2. **Updated Gemini AI Prompt**
   - ✅ Added all 4 actions to the action types list
   - ✅ Added documentation for each action
   - ✅ Added example commands for "Lock the screen" and "Shutdown computer"

### 3. **Implemented Cross-Platform Support**
   - ✅ Windows: Uses `rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation`
   - ✅ macOS: Uses CGSession
   - ✅ Linux: Uses `loginctl lock-session`

## How to Use

### In GUI App (gui_app.py):
Now you can type any of these commands:
- **"lock the screen"** - Locks your computer immediately
- **"lock my computer"** - Same as above
- **"shutdown computer"** - Shuts down in 10 seconds (requires confirmation)
- **"restart computer"** - Restarts in 10 seconds (requires confirmation)
- **"cancel shutdown"** - Cancels any scheduled shutdown/restart

### Direct Python Commands:
```bash
python quick_system_commands.py lock
python quick_system_commands.py shutdown
python quick_system_commands.py restart
python quick_system_commands.py cancel
```

### Batch Files (Windows):
- Double-click `quick_lock.bat` - Instant lock
- Double-click `quick_shutdown.bat` - Shutdown in 10 sec
- Double-click `quick_restart.bat` - Restart in 10 sec
- Run `desktop_file_controller.bat` - Full system control menu (options 14-18)

## Testing
To test if it works:
1. **Restart your GUI app** (close and reopen `gui_app.py`)
2. Type "lock the screen" in the command box
3. Should now work without errors! 🎯

## Note
If you still see the error after restarting, make sure:
1. Your Gemini API quota has reset (429 errors need time to clear)
2. The GUI app is fully closed and restarted
3. Python cache was cleared (done automatically)
