## 🔧 How the Integration Works

### Chatbot Initialization:
```python
# In gui_app.py line 30:
self.vatsal_ai = create_vatsal_ai()
```

### Starting a Conversation:
```python
# GUI calls this when user clicks "Start Conversation"
greeting = self.vatsal_ai.initiate_conversation()
# Returns: "Good morning! 🌅 I'm VATSAL, your AI assistant..."
```

### Sending Messages:
```python
# GUI calls this when user sends a message
response = await self.vatsal_ai.process_message(user_message)
# Returns: AI response with context from last 15 messages
```

### Getting Statistics:
```python
# GUI calls this to show stats
stats = self.vatsal_ai.get_stats()
# Returns: {
#   'total_messages': 10,
#   'user_name': 'User',
