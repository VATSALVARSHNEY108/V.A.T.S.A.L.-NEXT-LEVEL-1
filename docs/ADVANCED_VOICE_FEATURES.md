---

## 🎯 New Advanced Features

### 1. **💬 Conversation Mode**
Talk naturally without repeating the wake word!

#### How It Works
- Say wake word once (e.g., "Bhai")
- System enters conversation mode for 15 seconds
- Give multiple commands without saying wake word again
- Automatically exits after 15 seconds of inactivity

#### Example
```
You: "Bhai"
System: "At your service" [Enters conversation mode]

You: "open Chrome"
System: [Opens Chrome]

You: "search for Python tutorials"
System: [Searches]

You: "take a screenshot"
System: [Takes screenshot]

[After 15 seconds of silence]
System: [Exits conversation mode]
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Natural back-and-forth conversation
- ✅ No need to repeat wake word
- ✅ Auto-timeout prevents unintended commands
- ✅ Faster command execution

---

### 2. **🔗 Command Chaining**
Execute multiple commands with one voice input!

#### Supported Separators
- "and then"
- "then"
- "and also"
- "after that"

#### Examples
```
You: "Bhai open Chrome and then search for news"
System: "Executing 2 commands"
  1. Opens Chrome
  2. Searches for news

You: "Vatsal take a screenshot then open notepad and also search for weather"
System: "Executing 3 commands"
  1. Takes screenshot
  2. Opens Notepad
  3. Searches for weather
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Execute multiple tasks at once
- ✅ Natural language chaining
- ✅ Automatic pause between commands
- ✅ Clear execution feedback

---

### 3. **🎤 Voice Shortcuts/Macros**
Create custom voice commands that execute multiple actions!

#### Creating Shortcuts
In your code or GUI, you can create shortcuts:

```python
# Example: Create "morning routine" shortcut
voice_commander.add_voice_shortcut(
    trigger="morning routine",
    commands=[
        "show weather",
        "show calendar",
        "open email",
        "play lofi music"
    ]
)

# Example: Create "work mode" shortcut
voice_commander.add_voice_shortcut(
    trigger="work mode",
    commands=[
        "open code editor",
        "open spotify",
        "set focus timer for 25 minutes"
    ]
)
```

#### Using Shortcuts
```
You: "Bhai morning routine"
System: "Executing shortcut with 4 commands"
  ▶️ Shows weather
  ▶️ Shows calendar
  ▶️ Opens email
  ▶️ Plays music

You: "Vatsal work mode"
System: "Executing shortcut with 3 commands"
  ▶️ Opens code editor
  ▶️ Opens Spotify
  ▶️ Sets focus timer
```

**Managing Shortcuts:**
```python
# View all shortcuts
shortcuts = voice_commander.get_voice_shortcuts()

# Remove a shortcut
voice_commander.remove_voice_shortcut("morning routine")
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automate complex workflows
- ✅ One command for multiple actions
- ✅ Customizable to your needs
- ✅ Reusable routines

---

### 4. **📜 Command History**
Tracks all your voice commands automatically!

#### Features
- Stores last 50 commands
- Timestamps for each command
- Easy retrieval and review

#### Usage
```python
# Get last 10 commands
recent = voice_commander.get_command_history(limit=10)

# View all history
for entry in recent:
    print(f"{entry['timestamp']}: {entry['command']}")

# Clear history
voice_commander.clear_history()

# Check history count
status = voice_commander.get_status()
print(f"Commands in history: {status['command_history_count']}")
```

**Example Output:**
```
2025-01-15T10:30:45: open chrome
2025-01-15T10:31:12: search for python
2025-01-15T10:32:05: take screenshot
2025-01-15T10:33:20: play music
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Track what you've done
- ✅ Review command patterns
- ✅ Debug voice recognition issues
- ✅ Analyze usage

---

### 5. **🧠 Context Awareness**
System remembers context between commands!

#### How It Works
Store and retrieve context information:

```python
# Store context
voice_commander.set_context("last_file", "report.pdf")
voice_commander.set_context("current_project", "VATSAL")

# Retrieve context
file = voice_commander.get_context("last_file")
project = voice_commander.get_context("current_project", default="None")

# Clear all context
voice_commander.clear_context()
```

#### Use Cases
- Remember last opened file
- Track current project
- Store user preferences
- Maintain conversation state

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Smarter command execution
- ✅ Context-aware responses
- ✅ Personalized experience
- ✅ Follow-up commands

---

### 6. **📊 Enhanced Status**
Get complete system status including new features!

```python
status = voice_commander.get_status()
```

**Returns:**
```python
{
    "listening": True,
    "speaking": False,
    "wake_word_enabled": True,
    "wake_word": "vatsal",
    "wake_words": ["vatsal", "bhai", "computer", ...],
    "conversation_mode": True,
    "command_history_count": 15,
    "shortcuts_count": 3
}
```

## 🎭 Advanced Usage Examples

### Example 1: Complex Workflow
```

System: "Executing 3 commands"
  ✅ Opens Chrome
  ✅ Searches for AI news
  ✅ Takes screenshot

You: "now send that screenshot to my email"
System: [Sends screenshot]
```

### Example 2: Morning Routine Shortcut

voice_commander.add_voice_shortcut(
    trigger="start my day",
    commands=[
        "show weather",
        "show calendar for today",
        "open email",
        "open spotify and play focus music",
        "set pomodoro timer for 25 minutes"
    ]
)

# Use it daily
You: "Bhai start my day"
System: "Executing shortcut with 5 commands"
  ✅ Shows weather

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Conversation Mode Timeout
- **Default**: 15 seconds
- **Customizable**: Change timeout when enabling
- **Auto-reset**: Extends on each command
- **Silent exit**: No notification when timing out

```python
# Custom timeout
voice_commander.enable_conversation_mode(timeout=30)  # 30 seconds
```

### Command Chain Processing
Supports natural language separators:
- "and then" → Sequential execution
- "then" → Quick chaining
- "and also" → Additional tasks
- "after that" → Ordered steps

### History Limits
- **Max storage**: 50 commands
- **Auto-cleanup**: Removes oldest when full
- **Timestamps**: ISO format
- **Thread-safe**: Safe for concurrent access

## 📈 Feature Comparison

| Feature | Basic Mode | Advanced Mode |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| Wake Word | Required every time | Once per conversation |
| Multiple Commands | One at a time | Chain multiple |
| Shortcuts | Not available | Custom macros |
| History | Not tracked | Last 50 saved |
| Context | Not available | Full context support |
| Natural Language | Basic | Enhanced chaining |

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. **Use Conversation Mode for Related Tasks**
```
✅ Good:
"Bhai" → "open project" → "search docs" → "create file"

❌ Less efficient:
"Bhai open project" → "Vatsal search docs" → "Bhai create file"
```

### 2. **Create Shortcuts for Repeated Workflows**
If you do the same sequence daily, make it a shortcut!

### 3. **Use Command Chaining for Sequential Tasks**
```
✅ Good:
"open Chrome and then search for Python and then take screenshot"

❌ Slower:
"open Chrome" → [wait] → "search for Python" → [wait] → "take screenshot"
```

### 4. **Monitor Command History**
Review history to find patterns and create better shortcuts

### 5. **Clear Context When Starting New Task**
```python
voice_commander.clear_context()  # Start fresh
```
