## 🎯 Voice Command Best Practices

### Command Structure

**Good Examples:**
- "Take a screenshot" ✅
- "Search Google for Python tutorials" ✅
- "What's the weather today" ✅
- "Open downloads folder" ✅

**Less Optimal:**
- "Um... can you maybe... take a screenshot?" ❌
- Very long run-on sentences ❌
- Commands with lots of filler words ❌

### Natural Language

VATSAL understands context:
- "What time is it?" → Shows current time
- "How's my system doing?" → System report
- "Play some music" → Opens YouTube/Spotify
- "Help me code a calculator" → Generates code
