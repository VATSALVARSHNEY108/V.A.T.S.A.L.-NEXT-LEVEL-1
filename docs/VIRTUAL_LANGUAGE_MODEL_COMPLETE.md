# 🧠 Virtual Language Model - Complete Documentation

## Overview

The **Virtual Language Model (VLM)** is a self-learning AI system that observes your screen, builds knowledge about your desktop environment, and controls it intelligently based on what it has learned.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. **Screen Observation & Learning**
- Captures screenshots of your desktop
- Uses Gemini AI vision to analyze what's on screen
- Identifies UI elements, applications, layouts
- Builds visual memory of screen states

### 2. **Knowledge Building**
- **Visual Memory**: Stores screenshots and their AI interpretations
- **UI Patterns**: Learns common UI elements (buttons, menus, text fields)
- **Application Knowledge**: Remembers which apps you use and how they work
- **Workflows**: Learns multi-step processes

### 3. **Intelligent Decision Making**
- Analyzes goals using learned knowledge
- Decides best actions based on past experience
- Provides confidence scores for decisions
- Suggests alternative approaches

### 4. **Desktop Control**
- Executes actions based on decisions
- Clicks, types, launches applications
- Performs web searches
- Learns from outcomes (success/failure)

### 5. **Autonomous Learning**
- Can explore your desktop on its own
- Discovers new UI patterns
- Builds knowledge without supervision
- Improves over time

### 6. **Persistent Memory**
- Saves all learned knowledge to `vlm_memory.json`
- Remembers between sessions
- Accumulates experience over time

## 🎯 How It Works

### The Learning Cycle

```
1. OBSERVE → 2. ANALYZE → 3. LEARN → 4. DECIDE → 5. EXECUTE → (repeat)
```

### Detailed Flow

#### 1. **Observation**
```python
vlm.observe_screen("user requested observation")
```
- Takes screenshot
- Sends to Gemini AI for analysis
- Stores in visual memory
- Updates knowledge base

#### 2. **Analysis** (AI Vision)
- Describes what's on screen
- Identifies all UI elements
- Recognizes applications
- Finds interaction opportunities
- Detects patterns

#### 3. **Learning**
- Updates UI pattern database
- Records application information
- Stores interaction opportunities
- Builds workflow knowledge

#### 4. **Decision Making**
```python
decision = vlm.decide_action("Open Chrome and search for Python")
```
- Reviews learned knowledge
- Analyzes the goal
- Plans the best action
- Calculates confidence
- Suggests alternatives

#### 5. **Execution**
```python
result = vlm.execute_learned_action(decision)
```
- Observes screen before action
- Performs the action
- Observes screen after action
- Compares expected vs actual
- Learns from the outcome

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Observation
```python
from virtual_language_model import VirtualLanguageModel
from gui_automation import GUIAutomation

gui = GUIAutomation()
vlm = VirtualLanguageModel(gui)

# Observe the screen
result = vlm.observe_screen("initial observation")

# Check what was learned
print(result['analysis']['description'])
print(f"Found {len(result['analysis']['ui_elements'])} UI elements")
```

### Example 2: Goal-Based Action
```python
# Define a goal
goal = "Open Chrome and go to Google"

# Let AI decide the best action
decision = vlm.decide_action(goal)
print(f"Recommended: {decision['action']}")
print(f"Confidence: {decision['confidence']}")

# Execute the decision
result = vlm.execute_learned_action(decision)
```

### Example 3: Autonomous Learning
```python
# Run a 5-minute learning session
vlm.autonomous_learning_session(duration_minutes=5)

# Check what was learned
stats = vlm.get_stats()
print(f"Observations: {stats['observations']}")
print(f"UI Patterns: {stats['ui_patterns']}")
print(f"Known Apps: {stats['known_applications']}")
```

### Example 4: Query Knowledge
```python
# Ask about learned knowledge
answer = vlm.query_knowledge("What applications have you seen?")
print(answer)

answer = vlm.query_knowledge("What buttons are on Chrome?")
print(answer)
```

### Example 5: Learn a Workflow
```python
# Teach a multi-step workflow
workflow_steps = [
    {"action": "launch", "target": "Chrome"},
    {"action": "click", "target": "address bar"},
    {"action": "type", "text": "github.com"},
    {"action": "press", "key": "enter"}
]

vlm.learn_workflow("Open GitHub", workflow_steps)
```

2. **Error Handling**
   - Always check result dictionaries
   - Handle demo mode gracefully

3. **API Usage**
   - Be mindful of Gemini API calls
   - Observation = 1 API call with vision
   - Decision = 1 API call with text
