## 🎯 Features

### 1. 🎤 Voice Message Transcription
**Convert WhatsApp/Telegram audio messages to text**

⚠️ **STATUS: Framework Implementation**  
This feature provides the framework and structure for voice transcription. To enable full functionality, integration with a speech-to-text service (Google Speech-to-Text, OpenAI Whisper, etc.) is required.

**What's Implemented:**
- API framework ready for integration
- File and URL parameter handling
- Error handling and result formatting

**What's Needed:**
- Speech-to-text API credentials (Google Cloud, OpenAI, etc.)
- Audio processing libraries (librosa, pydub, etc.)
- Audio file download capability for URLs

**Example Structure:**
```python
# Framework is ready for integration
result = comm_enhancements.transcribe_voice_message(
    audio_file_path="message.mp3"
)
# Currently returns framework notification
# After integration: Returns actual transcription
```

**To Enable:**
```python
# Add to your implementation:
# 1. Install: pip install google-cloud-speech / openai
# 2. Add API credentials
# 3. Update transcribe_voice_message() with API calls
```

### 2. 💬 Smart Reply Suggestions
**Generate 3 quick reply options for any message**

AI generates three different reply options for emails and messages:
1. **Short & Quick** - Brief acknowledgment (1-2 sentences)
2. **Detailed & Thoughtful** - Comprehensive response (3-4 sentences)
3. **Action-Oriented** - Clear next steps (2-3 sentences)

**Use Cases:**
- Reply to emails faster
- Respond to SMS/WhatsApp messages professionally
- Save time with pre-generated options

**Example:**
```python
message_data = {
    "from": "john@example.com",
    "subject": "Project Update Request",
    "body": "Can you send me the latest project status?",
    "platform": "email"
}

result = comm_enhancements.generate_smart_replies(
    message_data=message_data,
    context="professional"  # or 'casual', 'friendly'
)

# Returns 3 reply options
for reply in result['replies']:
    print(f"{reply['type']}: {reply['text']}")
```

---

### 3. 📊 Email Priority Ranker
**Sort emails by real importance, not just sender**

AI analyzes email content to determine priority based on:
- Urgency keywords (urgent, ASAP, deadline, critical)
- Question marks and requests
- Sender importance
- Message length and complexity
- Thread history

**Priority Levels:**
- **Critical** (80-100): Immediate action required
- **High** (65-79): Important, respond soon
- **Medium** (40-64): Normal priority
- **Low** (0-39): Can wait

**Use Cases:**
- Manage inbox overload
- Focus on what matters
- Never miss urgent emails

**Example:**
```python
emails = [
    {
        "from": "boss@company.com",
        "subject": "URGENT: Client Meeting Today",
        "body": "We need to discuss the urgent client issue immediately."
    },
    {
        "from": "newsletter@site.com",
        "subject": "Weekly Newsletter",
        "body": "Here are the latest updates..."
    }
]

result = comm_enhancements.rank_emails_by_priority(emails)

# Shows emails sorted by priority score
for email in result['ranked_emails']:
    print(f"[{email['priority_level']}] {email['subject']}")
    print(f"Score: {email['priority_score']}/100")
    print(f"Reasons: {', '.join(email['priority_reasons'])}")
```

---

### 4. ⏰ Auto Follow-Up Reminder
**Never forget to follow up on important messages**

Set automatic reminders for unanswered emails and messages. The system tracks your communications and reminds you when it's time to follow up.

**Use Cases:**
- Follow up on job applications
- Check on pending requests
- Maintain professional relationships

**Example:**
```python
# Add a follow-up reminder
message_data = {
    "from": "client@example.com",
    "subject": "Proposal Review",
    "body": "I'll review your proposal and get back to you",
    "platform": "email",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-26T10:00:00"
}

result = comm_enhancements.add_follow_up_reminder(
    message_data=message_data,
    remind_in_days=3  # Remind in 3 days
)

# Check for due reminders
reminders = comm_enhancements.check_follow_up_reminders()
print(f"You have {len(reminders['due_reminders'])} follow-ups due")

# Mark as complete when done
comm_enhancements.mark_follow_up_complete("reminder_1")
```

### 8. 🎙️ Voice-to-Task Converter
**Turn spoken messages into tasks and calendar events**

Speak your thoughts, and AI converts them into structured tasks or calendar events with titles, priorities, deadlines, and action items.

**Detects:**

- **Events** - Meetings, appointments with date/time

**Extracts:**
- Title
- Description
- Priority (low, medium, high, urgent)
- Due date/time (if mentioned)
- Category (work, personal, meeting, etc.)
- Action items

**Use Cases:**
- Create tasks while driving
- Capture meeting notes hands-free
- Quick event scheduling

**Example:**
```python
voice_text = "Remind me to call the client tomorrow at 2 PM about the project proposal and send them the updated documents"

result = comm_enhancements.convert_voice_to_task(
    voice_text=voice_text,
    add_to_calendar=True  # Auto-add events to calendar
)

extracted = result['extracted']
print(f"Type: {extracted['type']}")  # event
print(f"Title: {extracted['title']}")  # Call client about project proposal
print(f"Date/Time: {extracted['datetime']}")  # 2025-10-27 14:00
print(f"Action Items: {extracted['action_items']}")  
# ['Call the client', 'Send updated documents']
```

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Managing Busy Inbox
```python
# 1. Rank your emails
emails = get_unread_emails()  # Your email fetching function
result = comm.rank_emails_by_priority(emails)

# 2. Focus on critical emails first
critical_emails = [e for e in result['ranked_emails'] 
                   if e['priority_level'] == 'Critical']

# 3. Generate smart replies
for email in critical_emails:
    replies = comm.generate_smart_replies(email, context="professional")
    # Pick the best reply option
    chosen_reply = replies['replies'][1]  # Detailed reply
    # Send it
```

### Example 2: International Team Communication
```python
# Slack message in French
message = {
    "from": "pierre@company.com",
    "body": "Quand pouvons-nous discuter du nouveau projet?",
    "platform": "slack"
}

# Auto-reply in French
reply = comm.generate_multilingual_reply(message)
print(reply['reply'])  # Response in French
```

# 1. Record meeting
meeting = {
    "title": "Sprint Planning",
    "date": "2025-10-26",
    "summary": "Planned next 2-week sprint",
    "key_points": ["Committed to 15 story points", "Added 3 bugs to backlog"],
    "action_items": ["Team: Complete sprint tasks", "PM: Update roadmap"]
}

# 2. Send notes automatically
comm.send_meeting_notes(
    meeting_data=meeting,
    recipients=["team@company.com"]
)

# 3. Set follow-up reminder

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: Smart replies seem generic?**
- Try adjusting the `context` parameter
- Provide more context in message_data
- Consider customizing the AI prompt

**Q: Email ranking not accurate?**
- Priority calculation learns from your patterns
- Manually review and adjust scores
- Add custom keywords to priority calculation

**Q: Language detection wrong?**
- Specify language explicitly instead of auto-detect
- Ensure message has enough text for detection
- Check translation service is configured

**Q: Meeting notes not sending?**
- Verify Gmail credentials are set
- Check recipient email addresses
- Review email sender configuration
